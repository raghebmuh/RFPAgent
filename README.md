  <strong>One Platform. Zero Hassle. Complete RFPs</strong>
</p>

<p align="left">
  This project represents an intelligent system that relies on an integrated team of artificial intelligence agents to strategically automate the Request for Proposals (RFP) lifecycle. The system begins by analyzing project requirements and aligning them with the organization's strategic objectives (Strategy), then automatically generates RFP documents and evaluation frameworks according to regulatory requirements and the Etimad platform. In the final stage, it sorts submitted proposals to nominate the best ones, ensuring governance, accelerating procedures, and effectively linking projects to the strategic direction.
